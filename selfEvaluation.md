# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
    - I'm still a little shaky. I watched the video (somehow missed that on the first read-through) and practiced like mad (plus my pair had some good insights), so now I'm feeling _much_ better.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
    - It's kind of like learning to swim by being thrown in the deep end! There was struggle of both kinds, though thankfully towards the end it was more productive struggle.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
    - I need to practice for statements that incorporate if/else/elsif statements. I was actually on the right path all evening, but it turns out I had my curly bracket in the wrong place (knowledge of which was brought on by watching the video)!
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
    - No immediate questions; I just have to practice. I say this only slightly with tongue-in-cheek, but my pair tonight, Adam, I think will prove to be a valuable resource.
